# Getting Started

To *administer* a competition, check out the [Basalt CLI docs](../cli/index.md).

To *participate* in a competition, download the
[Basalt desktop](https://github.com/basalt-rs/basalt/releases/latest).
Be sure to download the release appropriate for your OS and architecture.
You can also check our [install page](./install.md) to see whether Basalt
is in your OS's package repository.

Once you've installed and opened the application, you will be prompted to
provide the IP address of the server. After you've provided the IP, click
_next_ to continue to login.

Your login credentials will be provided to you by the competition
administrator. Once you've logged in, you're ready to begin competing!
